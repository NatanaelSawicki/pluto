Don't expect much from this library. Seriously, don't. 
It could be useful if you know what you're doing, but i wouldn't recommend it for a newcomer in programming.
Feel free to contribute, though.

(If you're willing to contribute, use english variables, camelCase on methods, PascalCase on classes, readable code, also JavaDoc if you find it necessary)
