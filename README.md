# PLUTO
Java Library with some cool tools and "bridges" to others libraries.
Don't expect much from this library. Seriously, don't. 
It could be useful if you know what you're doing, but i wouldn't recommend it for a newcomer in programming.
Feel free to contribute, though.

(It's a Gradle project, so be sure to get it's dependencies when pulling it, and make sure your IDE has support to Gradle Projects).

(If you're willing to contribute, use english variables, camelCase on methods, PascalCase on classes, readable code, also JavaDoc if you find it necessary.)
